# miRNA_SNP
Codes for microRNA polymorphism projects.  
RNA.snp.sh: a Shell script for running [RNAsnp](https://rth.dk/resources/rnasnp/) to compute the disruptive efect of SNPs on 3'UTR RNA structure.
RNAplfold.sh: a shell script for running [RNAplfold]() to compute the sum of structural accessibility for nucleotides within miRNA binding sites and evaluate the effect of SNPs on the RNA structural accessibility of miRNA target sites.
